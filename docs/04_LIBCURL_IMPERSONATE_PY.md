# Using curl-impersonate in PY-Scripts

It is possible to make [request_curl](https://github.com/Notifysolutions/request_curl) work with 
libcurl-impersonate instead of libcurl. Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/Notifysolutions/request_curl#usage-with-curl-impersonate) for more information.
